            <p>
                This ain't a song for the broken-hearted<br>
                No silent prayer for the faith-departed<br>
                I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd<br>
                You're gonna hear my voice<br>
                When I shout it out loud
            </p>
            <p>
                It's my life<br>
                It's now or never<br>
                I ain't gonna live forever<br>
                I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
                It's my life
            </p>
            <p>
                My heart is like the open highway<br>
                Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
                I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
                It's my life<br>
                This is for the ones who stood their ground<br>
                It's for Tommy and Gina who never backed down<br>
                Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake<br>
                Luck ain't enough, you've got to make your own breaks.<br>
                It's my life!
            </p>
